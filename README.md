# Monster-Clustering
# This data set includes 723 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.
# But for the purpose of better use of data, my mentor added some applicable features like Color, Gender, Height, Weight, Catch Rate and Body Style with some personal touch.
